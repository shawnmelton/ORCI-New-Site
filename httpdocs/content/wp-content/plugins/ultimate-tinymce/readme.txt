Description: Beef up your visual tinymce editor with a plethora of advanced options.

== Description ==

Are you a visual person?  Do the letter combinations "HTML" and "CSS" send you running for the hills; but you still want to create beautiful blogs like the pros?  Then this is the plugin for you!

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01reHnBCAIA]

<strong>Ultimate TinyMCE</strong> will add over 40 new buttons to the default visual tinymce editor, giving you the power to visually create your pages and posts. No need for mucking about in HTML and CSS.

<strong>How will Ultimate TinyMCE Help You?</strong>
<ul>
<li>No need to learn the languages of HTML and CSS (although the basics can certainly help) when creating your pages/posts.</li>
<li>Easily manipulate your fonts, font sizes, colors, styles, and css from a graphical user interface.</li>
<li>Shortcodes Manager - Now all your shortcodes are available in a handy dropdown box.</li>
<li>Create tables through a grahical interface (much like microsoft excel) to display your data.</li>
<li>Insert YouTube videos by simply copying and pasting the share url.</li>
<li>Graphical Image Mapping to make your images more exciting.</li>
<li>Use shortcodes to insert column breaks.  This is a VERY cool feature.  You can break any content area into up to six separate columns.</li>
<li>Ultimate Tinymce will add more than 50 new buttons and features to your visual editor.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Note:</strong>
We have decided to discontinue development of Ultimate Tinymce. We wil continue to maintain the plugin, and ensure it remains compatible with future releases of WordPress.

However, our development efforts will be focused on the PRO version.  All new features will only be added to PRO.  Thank you for understanding.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory, or download and install automatically through your admin panel.
     
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3.  You will need to manually activate your buttons the first time you install.  You can do this by going to the admin panel, settings page, Ultimate TinyMCE.  Here, you can set your preferences.

== Changelog ==

= 4.7 =
* 05-23-2013

= Bug Fixes =
* Fixed menu page "knocking out" other pages.
* Fixed two erroneous commas in "mce_langs.php" file which was causing errors in IE.

= 4.6 =
* 05-08-2013

= New Features =
* Removed all metaboxes and re-configured using a tabbed section.  This should make "option navigation" a bit easier.

* Added an admin tour using wp-pointers.

= Removed Features =
* Removed support the developer.

= Updated Addons =
* Updated the CodeMagic addon.  This fixes much of the white-space issues when moving content between the editor and the CodeMagic window.

= Bug Fixes=
* Updated all addon language strings into the common Ultimate Tinymce language localization.  This means all the addon text strings can now be translated using the Ultimate Tinymce plugin .po and .mo language files.  Also, it prevents the similar looking "table.table_desc" being displayed instead of the actual text string.  My apologies to Translators... this has added approximately 800 new text strings to the plugin.  But, now it is done correctly ;)
* Fixed YouTube bug where video options were not working properly (such as related videos, or play in hd).
* Fixed save buttons not displaying properly in some browsers (removed center html tags; replaced with margins).

= Tweaks =
* Consolidated "Buttons 1" and "Buttons 2" into a single "Buttons tab.  This will cause all options that were set for "Buttons 2" to be lost.  These will need to be re-configured.  I apologize for the invonvenience... but it had to be done to put the "tabs" together.

= 4.5 =
* 04-20-2013

= New Features =
* A new panel for quickly configuring plugin settings and options.

= Removed Items =
* Removed options for setting other plugins buttons.  A new interface will be added soon.

* Updated plugin uninstallation script to completely remove database options.

= 4.4 =
* 04-09-2013
* Fixed mis-informed option.

= 4.3.1.4 =
* WP Release

= 4.3.1.3 =
* 04-05-2013

= Maintenance Release =
* Websites were experiencing long loading times.  The new option has been removed until further testing can be completed.  I sincerely apologize for any inconveniences.  Thank you for your patience and understanding!  I do my best to keep your websites safe, stable, and secure!  If that means multiple, consectutive updates... so be it!  Thank you.

= 4.3.1.2 =
* 04-04-2013

= Maintenance Release =
* Had a syntax error in the column-styles.css file.  This was preventing columns (already published) to not display properly.  This update fixes the CSS issue.. and will restore normality to column shortcodes.

= 4.3.1.1 =
* 04-04-2013

= Maintenance Release =
* Forgot a closing symbol in the code which was "blowing out" website spacing; and also generating a warning in the footer area.  This was my mistake.. and I sincerely apologize.

= 4.3.1 =
* 04-04-2013

= Bug Fixes =
* Removed new CSS checkbox styles; not rendering properly in IE versions 8 and below (it's always something with IE).  I will work on this, and get something more cross-browser compliant.

= 4.3 =
* 04-03-2013

= Bug Fixes =
* Fixed shortcode class names using a unique namespace.  Some shortcodes were interfering with another theme.

* Tweaked option to remove all plugin beautifications.

= 4.2 =
* 03-14-2013

= Tweaks =
* I opted to remove the pop-up help files from the plugin. They have been moved to the <a href="http://utmce.joshlobe.com/button-definitions/">Ultimate Tinymce Official Website</a>. This has reduced the plugins file size by half.

* The "Scroll to Top" javascript arrow on the admin settings page has been removed, as it was interfering with some installations where the left menu extended down off the bottom of the page.



= 4.1 =
* 03-10-2013

= Bug Fixes =
* Fixed bug with QR Content functionality.
* Fixed "insert/embed media" button not working properly.
* Adjusted all addon .php files back to .htm files.  I originally did this to increase the backwards compatibility.  However, I have found it creates more issues than advantages.  I have decided it is much better to remain updated and secure, than to attempt supporting backwards compatibility.  Please read the WP plugin download page to see compatibility.

= 4.0.9 =

* Fixed "Session Start" Errors. I consider this a critical update. 

= 4.0.5 =
* 01-22-2013

= Tweaks =
* Added option to completely disable all plugin author styling.  This will give the plugin admin settings page a very "vanilla" WordPress feel.  All tabs, sidebar information, plugins listing styles, scroll to top button, etc. will be removed.  This option can be found in the "Admin Options" of the settings page.

= 4.0.4 =
* 01-17-2013

= Bug Fixes =
* Fixed Advanced Insert/Edit link button.
* Fixed Clear Div buttons.
* Fixed NextPage button.

= Tweaks =
* Moved the above mentioned three buttons out of the "Misc Features" section and into the "Buttons Group 2" section.

= 4.0.3 =
* 01-08-2013

= Bug Fixes =
* Fixed IE errors with "uncaught" and "undefined" errors.  This was preventing the plugin from functioning properly in Internet Explorer browsers.

= Bug Fixes =
* Fixed problem with IE8 and editor not displaying properly.

= 4.0.1 =
* 01-02-13

= Tweaks =
* Updated Japanese language translation.  Thanks Takuro Hishikawa!
* Added some code for BBPress compatibility (unsets "teeny" mode in bbpress).

* Adjusted tinymce file to use WP's version.  This means, there will no longer be incompatibility should WP choose to change the file again.
* Because of the item above; all addon files had to be changed from .html to .php.  VERY labor intensive.. so please report any errors.

= 3.8 =
* 12-12-12

= Tweaks =
* Made a few adjustments and fixes to be 3.5 compliant.

= 3.7 =
* 12-03-2012

= 3.6 =
* 11-11-2012

= IMPORTANT =
* I had to remove the Image Manager.  There is an exploit in the file swfulpoad.swf which can cause a security issue.  I was contacted by WordPress and asked to remove this security issue.  So, I am working on a new version which does not use the file.  I do apologize.. but some things are beyond my control.
* You may read more about the threat, <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Nov/51">HERE</a>.

* Added a subscription button (sidebar) to receive plugin updates, news, and tutorials.

* Re-coded Image Manager addon so that each user will have their own storage space.  This is configured automatically, depending on the users unique ID.  NOTE: If you have already uploaded images.. then they will not appear when you update.  So, if you don't know how to get them back, please contact me and I'll provide step-by-step instructions on how to get back your images.

= Removed =
* Developer recommendations section.  The plugin admin panel is getting too big and it was taking up space.  I will probably add a "tabbed" section in a future update.
* Themefuse banner and link.

= NOTES =
* The image manager may require some adjustments depending on individual server configurations.  If this feature is not working for you, please visit my support forum where users are reporting various fixes.

= Tweaks =

* Re-worded the options under "Miscellaneous Settings".


= 3.3 =
* 10-14-2012

= New Metabox Panel =
* Added a new options panel for over-riding tinymce settings (Content Editor Tinymce Over-Rides).  This will allow you to choose a default background color, font color, etc. to use in the content editor.  Please read the included help file before using these options.
* These options do nothing to the front-end of the website... they only modify the CSS used in the tinymce content editor.

= New Features =

* Added addon for using Clker's open-source, free clip-art galleries.

= Tweaks =

* Changed "Signoff" textbox to an Ultimate Tinymce textbox.
* Added link and info box for <a href="http://ultimatetinymcepro.com">Ultimate Tinymce PRO</a>.

* Fixed admin styles not being called on certain installations.
* Modified the content.css file to prevent interference when used with other plugins who also modify the content_css of tinymce.


= Deleted Options =
* None

= Notes =
* None


= 2.9 =
* 08-01-2012

= New Features =
* Added a button to check validation of content against w3cvalidator (or you may select a different validator by entering the link).  Validations can be checked using five different options including xhtml 1.1 and xhtml 1.0 strict.
* Added button used for inserting "dummy" Lorem Ipsum text. This is very handy for anyone just setting up a site; or wanting to test a feature which needs text in the editor. Choose from five different languages (including English!), and also from paragraphs, sentences, or lists.
* Added new tinymce plugin for inserting any HTML5 compliant html tag. Select the content, push the button, select the tag, and it's automatically wrapped around the selected content.  A PERFECT companion for my premium <a href="http://www.plugins.joshlobe.com/ultimate-tinymce-classes-and-ids/">Classes and ID's</a> plugin.
* Added toggle buttons to show/hide editor rows during content editing. (can be disabled via admin settings page).
* Added option (admin settings) to toggle off the HTML tab in the content editor.
* Tinymce Excerpt Area is back!!  This will add the tinymce visual editor to the post excerpt area.  (Code has been re-written and tested.)

= Tweaks =
* Changed Shortcodes popup to wrap selected content with selected shortcode... tweaked from "replacing" selected content.
* Changed import/export functions.  These will create a file to import/export, rather than having to copy settings.

= Bug Fixes =
* Fixed warning at top of shortcodes popover when wp-debug is set to true.
* Fixed bug with <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cleverness-to-do-list/">"Cleverness To-Do List"</a> plugin.


= Deleted Options =
* None

= Notes =
* The excerpt area tinymce should be solid. Next, I'll be looking on how to do this with the comment section area.
* The HTML5 tags button is my first large tinymce plugin project.  There is a LOT of text, and quite a few files; please feel free to report any issues.
* I'm probably going to have to re-write the options panel once more.  The issue is with importing/exporting options.  Long story short, I'm learning how to best deal with all the features included with Ultimate Tinymce while still maintaining an easy to use options panel.  This will require updating the settings manually once again. Be sure to watch the changelog for when this will take effect.


= 2.8 =
* 07-25-12

= IMPORTANT NOTICE =
* This version of the plugin is written with a completely new interface for saving options.  YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR SETTINGS, AND THEY WILL NEED TO BE MANUALLY RESET.  I'm sorry.  There is simply no way for me to manually write a function which will move all stored options to the new configuration.

= New Features =
* NEW SHORTCODES INTERFACE.  I just finished this new plugin.  Please let me know how it works for everyone.  (Bottom of Buttons Group Two)
* Added option for tinymce in comments field, allowing visitors to leave comments using a lightweight (custom) version of tinymce.
* Changed QR textbox to a visual editor.  Now content can be added visually with (teeny) tinymce.

= Tweaks =
* Added master controls for each "buttons group" section.  You can check all/uncheck all, and also set the row for all buttons with one click.
* Added option to export and import each buttons group independently.  The main Import/Export has now been removed, and each buttons group has an independent export/import feature.

= Bug Fixes =
* Fixed plugin uninstallation bug which was using a deprecated function.
* Fixed bugs with various issues, primarily from usage of isset().  This is why I re-wrote the options configuration again.

= Deleted Options =
* The old Shortcodes dropdown interface is dead.  I spent three days attempting to get this working... unsuccessfully.  However, there is a new button for working with shortcodes.  See "New Features" above.
* The old Export/Import section has been removed.  See "Tweaks" above.

= Notes =
* All options groups now have a unique "Save Options" button.  Pressing each button ONLY saves the options for that group.  Work one section at a time when configuring settings.

= 2.7.1 =
* 07-20-12

= New Features =
* Working with <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/opajaap/">OpaJaap's</a> plugin <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-photo-album-plus/">WP Photo Album Plus</a>, I added a button which allows row selection and enable/disable for his visual editor button.  I'm hoping other plugin developers will hop on board.  If you are using a plugin, and would like to have control of it via Ultimate Tinymce, contact the plugin author and myself and we might be able to make it work!

= Tweaks and Updates =
* Added additional options to QR Code option.  Now, when checked, new options will expand giving control over color selection and text.
* Added option to use QR's on pages also.
* Added javascript color picker popup to color selection boxes under QR code.

* Fixed bug using isset() on options.

= 2.7 =

* 07-17-12

= New Features =
* Added button for inserting YouTube videos using the new iFrame procedure.
* Added plugin for inserting tons of math formatting options.  This uses a third-party plugin which makes accessible hundreds of math, trig, calc, and algebra functions... all displayed neatly within the content editor.  Perfect for teachers, students, engineers, physicists, etc.
* Added a new QR (Quick Response) code option.  When enabled, a new box will be inserted at the bottom of every post with a unique qr code.  This can then be used by smart devices for sharing and whatever else.  Any feedback is greatly appreciated.  (Setting can be found under "Admin Options")

= Tweaks and Modifications =
* I decided to move all files required to load the tinymce and it's functionality into the plugin folder.  Hoping this will clear up a lot of the smaller issues people are having with misc. features being buggy.
* I will update these files anytime Wordpress or Tinymce are updated.  (Basically, any time the files change)
* Re-wrote all the popup windows for each button to use these newly located files.
* Added images for the buttons of "pagebreak" and "div clear".

= 2.6.1 =

* 06-28-12
* Tweak: Removed 30 day donation notice.
* Bugfix: Fixed notices being generated when WP-DEBUG is set to true.  Forgot to add the 'isset' check to each option.
* Bugfix: Fixed some images spilling over the content area on admin page.

= 2.6 =

* 06-18-12
* <strong>MAJOR UPGRADE:</strong>
* Update: Datbase Optimization: Re-wrote all options into a single array stored in the database.
* The first time you update, you will need to run the "Optimize Database" feature in the "Import/Export Settings" box to restore your settings.
* This will seek out all entries in the database used for this plugin, and re-write them into a single array, and delete the originals.
* You will only need to do this if you are updating from a previous version.
* I do apologize if settings need to be re-set.  I did my best to make this conversion process as bug-free as possible.

* Update: Added options for exporting/importing the plugin settings.
* This can be also be used to store individual plugin settings configurations, which can be loaded "on-demand"... or even used for sharing.

* Note: I have also begun to write the code for my drag-n-drop feature.  This code is in the plugin, but has been commented out until development is complete.

= 2.5 =
* 06-08-12

* Update: Added function to "refresh" the tinymce editor on each page load.  Tinymce is BAD at caching information making it difficult to see when you've made an adjustment.  This function will fix that problem, and force the editor to reload on each page refresh. (This option can be switched in the admin panel)
* Update: Added plugin which adds a button and allows selected content to be wrapped with a span tag.  This is primarily intended for use with my <a href="http://www.plugins.joshlobe.com/ultimate-tinymce-classes-and-ids/">Ultimate Tinymce Classes and IDs</a> addon.
* Update: Added layers plugin for tinymce.  This feature works best using the Mozilla Firefox web broswer.

* Tweak: Fixed two broken links in plugins admin page.
* Tweak: Added updated Czech language file.

= 2.3 =
* 05-22-12

NOTE: Any modifications to this file ONLY affect content inside the editor and is NOT rendered on the front-end of the website.
* Update: Added Czech language files.  Thanks to <a href="http://chcistranky.eu/zdarma/">Pavel Bilek</a>.
* Update: Added Hindi language files.  Thanks to <a href="http://outshinesolutions.com/">Outshine Solutions</a>.

* Tweak: Updated the "popup.css" file to be set to ltr languate... for the same reason mentioned above.
* Tweak: Adjusted various elements into measurements of percentages rather than pixels.  This will help when viewing the settings page on various screen resolutions.
* Tweak: Added a metabox for suggested plugins and themes.  These have been tested by me personally, and work extremely well with Ultimate Tinymce.  If I use them and are happy with them, I will list them on the admin page as recommended additions.  (NOTE) Any plugin or theme in this box was NOT developed by me unless otherwise stated.

= 2.0.2 =
* 04-27-12
* Bugfix: Removed the User Roles until I can figure out why multisites are having trouble.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  If anyone is interested in helping me test on multisites, please contact me via email.

= 2.0.1 =
* 04-27-12
* Bugfix: Problem with super admin and multisite installations addressed.

= 2.0 =
* 04-26-12
* New Feature: User Roles options are now available.  The Ultimate Tinymce options are set for admin by default.  With this new option, you can enable the advanced options for other user levels.
* Bugfix: I had already added some of this code in the last update.  So, one of the options appeared without actually being available.  This is fixed now.
* Tweak: A new metabox is now available for "User Roles".  This is where you can select your custom user levels.  

= 1.9 =
* 04-23-12
* New Feature: Added ability to save the scrollbar position after saving a post/page.  This prevents the scrollbar from jumping to the top of the post/page after saving or publishing content.
* Bugfix: Finished renaming all functions and appended `jwl_` to the beginning of each, so as not to conflict with other plugins possibly using the same function names.
* Tweak: Added 30 day reminder for donating.  My apologies to all who have already donated.  Thank you.  This message will popup after 30 days of having the plugin installed.  There is also a link to permanently dismiss the message when it appears.
* Tweak: Removed half of the screenshots from the plugin (7 total), reducing plugin file size.

= 1.8 =
* 04-15-12
* NOTICE: This plugin version (and beyond until otherwise noted) is now only compatible with Wordpress version 3.3.1 and above.
* Bugfix: Fixed admin message being shown to all users.  Now, only admin will see admin messages.
* Update: Re-implemented "Help" tab for admin ultimate tinymce settings page.
* Tweak: Added function which will display row 2 of the editor by default when opening any post/page.
* Tweak: Removed a few pieces from the admin tab section, relocated to the new "Help" tab in the upper-right corner.
* Tweak: Miscellaneous tweaks for Internet Explorer compatibility.  (Although I don't encourage IE... use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a> instead!)

= 1.7.9 =
* 04-09-12
* Notice: This will be the last plugin version before REQUIRING Wordpress version 3.3.1 or higher.  My next plugin version will begin utilizing new API's only available in 3.3.1 and higher.
* Upgrade: I "reduced" the main.php file into several, more easily manageable, files.  This will help dramatically with loading times on the plugin settings page, and the content editor page.
* Tweak: Performed a major renovation on coding.  Separating the main file into several smaller files made it easier for me to work with the code.  It is now easy to read, highly notated, and more concise.

= 1.7.8 =
* 04-04-12
* I wanted to begin a new version sequence now that the plugin is reported as stable across various platforms.
* Most of the code has been re-arranged on the main.php file, trying to make it easier for editing.
* I intend to break the main.php file into multiple smaller segments, to make it more managable.  This will have no effect on any settings or usage of the plugin.

* Those who are heavy users of this plugin, and who have not upgraded the Wordpress core to at least version 3.3.1 will want to do so in the very near future.  I plan to implement a few new features which rely on code only available in 3.3.1 and later.  This is not a final warning, but just letting those know the moment is getting close.

* A special thanks to everyone who contributes to the development of this plugin with their time, constructive feedback, suggestions for improvement, and most importantly, financial donations.  Those who help financially, are the ones who keep this plugin alive and moving forward.  So, a very heartfelt thank you to everyone who has helped!!

= 1.7.7.4 =
* 04-02-12
* Update: Added tab for users to apply the developers suggested default settings for this plugin.  My recommended settings will be automatically loaded and saved.
* Udate: Added "Admin Options" new metabox on settings page.  
* Update: Added two new settings under "Admin Options".  One for controlling the dashboard widget.  The other for controlling the link in the admin menu bar.
* Tweak: Fixed link from admin bar to settings page when viewing from the front-end of the website.  Thanks Jessica!
* Tweak: Added rss feed to dashboard widget.  The rss feed is from my wordpress plugins development website.
* Tweak: Allowed users to specify the number of posts to display in dashboard widget.  (click "configure" on dashboard widget)
* Tweak: Slightly modified various parts of the main tab section.

= 1.7.7.3 =
* 04-01-12
* Bugfix: Fixed error message regarding "Call to undefined function is_plugin_active()".

= 1.7.7.2 =
* 04-01-12
* Bugfix: Spacing issue with "update options" button, and the box directly beneath.
* Tweak: Removed most inline css used to display the admin settings page.  Most all css (for the settings page) is now rendered from a separate css file.
* Tweak: Added an "Admin Tips" section in the main tab area; explaining different features of the admin settings page.
* Tweak: Localized all admin settings page translation strings.  Still have to do the help popup pages.
* Tweak: Added a link to the top admin bar for quick access back to the plugin settings page.
* Tweak: The admin bar menu will dynamically generate new links if a user installs any of the available addons; taking them directly to the relevant settings page.
* Tweak: Added a dashboard widget.  Currently, it is being used for links.  However, I will incorporate a dedicated news feed into this widget in a future update.

= 1.7.7.1 =
* 03-31-12
* Tweak: Added unique screen icon to admin settings page.
* Tweak: Extended width of first column settings.  Some were spilling one word to the second line.  It was driving me nuts!
* Update: Added more information to the "Tabbed" area.  Getting ready to eliminate some of the sidebar content areas.
* Update: Removed feature to enable the tinymce editor in the excerpt area.  This feature was buggy, and I want to focus on bigger challenges.
* Update: Removed the custom styles option.  My plugin addons can offer a better option, with extended features.
* Update: Consolidated the remaining three options from the "Advanced" metabox to the "Miscellaneous Features" betabox.  There are now only three main options boxes.  Basically, the bottom two options boxes have been merged.

= 1.7.7 =
* 03-30-12
* Update: Another re-design to the admin panel.  Trying to clean up the length of the settings page.
* Update: I'm thinking about making the entire admin panel jquery.  This would allow users to "tab" through each metabox area rather than having to scroll down the page.  Use my feedback form to let me know what you think.
* Update: Getting closer to a true drag-n-drop experience with the buttons.  Check out this link for a "sneak-peek": http://www.joshlobe.com/test
* <strong>Notice:</strong> I've changed the "requires" version to 3.3.1 on the plugin download page.  Currently, this plugin will still work on 2.8 and above.
* <strong>Notice:</strong> Watch the changelog to see when the plugin steps up to 3.3.1; I will make sure to announce it here.  Once it does, the plugin will no longer work on any Wordpress version below 3.3.1 (to my understanding).

= 1.7.6.1 =
* 03-27-12
* Bugfix: Installation Error "Class 'WP_Screen' not found..." Fixed.
* Update: This error of "Class WP_Screen not found" is due to wordpress installations using a version below 3.3.1.  I plan to implement this feaure in a future release, so users will need to upgrade to at least wordpress version 3.3.1 to continue enjoying the features of Ultimate Tinymce.  Please watch the changelog before downloading updates to check for compatibility with your wordpress version.

= 1.7.6 =
* 03-25-12
* Adding a new Help System.  This can be accessed by clicking "Help" in the top-right of the settings page.
* I didn't plan for this release this soon.  So, the new help system is incomplete.  I will be adding to this in future updates.
* Adjusted save buttons back to normal (Renamed them to "Update Options").  Now each button will save ALL options, regardless of which button is clicked.
= Bug Fixes: =
* Removed Google Maps (again).
* Issues saving posts/pages. (Google Maps Related)
* Issues when working with images. (Google Maps Related)
* Issues with copy/paste. (Google Maps Related)

= 1.7.5.1 =
* 03-23-12
* Bugfix with copy/paste buttons.

= 1.7.5 =
* 03-23-12
* Completely overhauled the admin panel settings page.  
* ---> Now you can drag/drop, open/close, and sort whichever metboxes you like.
* ---> Visit the "Screen Options" tab in the top right corner for even more customization.
* ---> Follow this <a href="http://youtu.be/-Y76wqkRMWk">SCREENCAST</a> to watch a short video explaining the new interface.
* Added functionality to select which row each button will appear in the editor.
* Added a check all/uncheck all option when choosing buttons.
* Added Google Maps back to the plugin.  I believe all bugs have been worked out.

= 1.7.4.1 =
* 03-12-12
* Removed jquery causing issues throughout admin panel.  I will write my own jquery for the toggles.

= 1.7.4 =
* 03-10-2012
* Beginning a dating sequence for plugin updates.
* Added Turkish translation.  Thanks Münip Öniz !!
* Added option to remove all database entries when deactivating the plugin.
* Added jquery to the main options panels.  This will allow you to expand/collapse the title bars.
* Removed a function I forgot to delete after testing purposes.

= 1.7.3.1 =
* I had to temporarily remove the Google Maps feature, as it was causing conflicts with other buttons (inserting and saving emoticons, some popups not opening, etc.).  I'll continue to work on this, and reimplement it in a future release.
* Fixed warning message about "Plugin generated xxx characters of unexpected output".  This was due to an improper usage of the `foreach` php code.  The code has been rewritten and is valid.

= 1.7.3 =
* Added Google Maps button and plugin; giving a graphical interface for inserting Google Maps.
* Added Shortcodes dropdown selector.  This new button will list all of your available shortcodes in your theme. It allows you to highlight selected text and wrap the shortcode around it with a click from the dropdown menu.
* Added option for disabling wpautop.  wpautop is responsible for inserting the <strong>p</strong> and <strong>br</strong> tags into your front end pages.  NOTE:  Please read the associated help file for more info before enabling this option.
* Added a very cool feature which allows you to select from many different styles to apply to the tinymce editor box.  You can see the "Rainbow" effect on the description tab of this plugin.  Currently, there are six options; Pink, Green, Dark Pink, Dark Green, Rainbow, and Steel.
* Fixed bug with alert boxes image tiling unexpectedly.
* Updated a few of the help files.
* Added two additional optional addon plugins in the list on the admin page.  These will be paid plugins.  
* One is a Google Fonts manager, which provides an easy admin panel (and step-by-step instructions) on how to choose any combination of Google webfonts, and incorporate them into your site.
* The second is going to be a Custom Styles dropdown box customizer.  It will allow you to add your own custom styles to the dropdown box and have them applied to your website.  This will be ideal for giving clients the ability to select custom defined styles they can easily apply to their content.  This plugin will be available soon.

= 1.7.2 =
* Fixed bug with column shortcodes. (Seriously, this time ;)
* Added a few translation strings from the admin panel, which were not previously available for translation.
* Corrected David's website; in appreciation for Italian translation.
* Fixed example with column shortcodes.  I accidentally used a hypen in the example rather than an underscore.  So, when using any column shortcode, you should ALWAYS use underscores.  For example,<strong>[one_half]</strong>Example Content<strong>[/one_half]</strong>

= 1.7.1 =
* Fixed bug with the "Advanced Insert/Edit Link" button where NextGen Gallery button (and others) were not being displayed properly.
* Fixed bug with the column shortcode usage.  (Was generating a warning, rendering certain code inoperable).
* Fixed bug where the moods addon plugin was not showing as installed.  (Was always showing Inactive)
* Added a couple of additional options with inserting YouTube videos.
* Moved the animated moods button (when installed and activated) to row 2 of the editor.
* Added Italian translation files.  Thanks <a href="http://www.davidpesarin.wordpress.com">David</a>.


= 1.7.0 =
* I decided to remove the animated mood smilies from the plugin.  The plugin now weighs a lean 2.78 megabytes.
* The animated moods is now available as an addon plugin, and can be downloaded here:<br />http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/moods-addon-for-ultimate-tinymce/
* If you have inserted any moods into your content, please check to ensure they still display properly.  Since the images will have been moved to another folder, it's possible they won't be displayed.  You may need to go back and re-insert them again with the new addon.  I apologize for any inconvenience.
* Added a new box in the admin settings page for showing available addon plugins, and whether or not they are installed and activated.
* I figure this sort of option may be useful in the future when developing additional addons.
* Added a shortcode useage for line breaks in the editor.  By simply typing the shortcode <strong>[break]</strong>, you can insert line breaks in your post/page content that are safe while switching views and saving.  See the associated help file for more information on usage.
* Added column support.  Now you can split your post/page content into multiple columns.<br /><br />Example usage:  [two_third]This content would be in a  column two-thirds of the page width.[/two_third][one_third_last]This is the last one-third of the width.[/one_third_last]<br /><br />See the associated help file for more information.

= 1.6.9 =
* Added a separate button for the "Advanced Insert/Edit Link" feature.  Now, you have a new button next to the wordpress buttons for linking and unlinking.  No more having to go back and forth to the plugin settings page.  Check the help file in the plugin settings page for more info.
* Updated my documentation to help with the link features.  Please let me know if you spot any inconsistencies.
* Added a button for turning on/off Visual Characters.
* Added a button which allows you to print your post from the editor.
* Added a button for automatically inserting the date or the time.  Let me know if this feature is useful, and if so, I can add some custom options allowing you to set how you want your date or time to be displayed.
* I am seriously considering removing the "Animated Moods" feature.  This would free up about 5 megabytes of space to allow for newer features.  I'm already nearing 10 megabytes on the plugin now.  So, if this is of dire need to you, please use my forum or my contact form to voice your opinion.

= 1.6.8 =
* Removed the old tables option and replaced it with a new drop-down box table button.  This consolidated all the table buttons into a nicely organized drop-down list.  You still have the exact same options.
* Added a "Next Page" feature.  This will allow you to use the wordpress page break to "break" your post into multiple pages.  Click the help icon in the admin settings page for more information and examples.
* Added additional font sizes.  The drop-down list will look a little "funny", but if you hover over the font, it will tell you the size.
* Removed the custom register/login box option.  I have created a different plugin with this feature.  If you liked it, please download the plugin <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-welcome-messages/">HERE</a>.
* Moved the 'styles' button to the first position in row 4 of the editor.  This helped with spacing issues.
* Made a few width and height adjustments in the 'emotions' and 'youtube' popup windows.
* Updated Bloggers section.
* Slightly modified the feedback form.
* Added a "Plugin Poll" to find out the demand for newer features.
* Added a Mozilla Firefox box and link to admin settings page.  In my opinion, Firefox is the best browser to use with the visual tinymce editor.
* Removed some miscellaneous junk files and code.

= 1.6.7 =
* Added more to the contextual help sections.
* Removed the toggle switch, as it was not compatible across browsers.  I will tweak some more and add again in a future update.
* Tweaked the editor button popup windows with some custom css.  Trying to make them a little more "pleasing" on the eyes.
* Insert and Cancel buttons in the popups are now colorized.
* Working on implementing yet another settings section, which will allow fine-tuning over the tinymce initialization process.  I have most of the code in place, but still working out the last few bugs.  This should be fully operational in my next update.


= 1.6.6 =
* Implemented a new dropdown table buttons feature.  Instead of having 11 buttons side by side, taking up valuable real estate, this new option will add a dropdown list for the different buttons.  A HUGE space saver!
* Implemented a new HTML viewer button.  This one is Awesome!!  Complete with syntax highlighter, line numbers, auto-complete, and undo,redo history.
* Added a YouTube button.  This will allow you to simply enter the video ID and the plugin does the rest, embedding the video directly into your post/page.
* Added a cool feature using Image Maps.  You can create basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and polygons; and insert them over an image, and they will each link to a separate place or content.
* Designed a toggle switch that will "hide" and "show" all the rows of the editor.
* I moved a lot of the CSS files around and made them easier for me to navigate while continuing plugin development.  If some of your CSS doesn't load properly, make sure to empty any cache you are using on your website; clear your browsers cache; and reload the page.


= 1.6.5 =
* Updated most of the contextual help sections.
* Tables will have to wait until the next update (I want to be specific with this one).
* Removed the Microsoft Word Help Document.  I will make this available as a download on my <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">Support Forum</a> for anyone interested.
* Fixed missing reference to stylesheet "pop-upstyle.css".

= 1.6.4 =
* Added support for shortcode usage in widget areas.  You can now use any shortcode available in your theme (or other plugins) in your widget areas.
* I'm In process of performing a HUGE contextual help system.  Each option now has a little "Help" icon, which when clicked will open a new window with help information specific to that option.
* This will be a "work-in-progress" over the next few updates.
* Switched my Feedback Form to another provider.  It should remain in working order from here on out.

= 1.6.3 =
* Added a custom message box which will display on your register/login page. This is available from within the admin panel settings page. Simply "check" the box, enter your message, and it will magically be displayed on your register/login form just above the login box. This can, of course, be styled however you like.
* Added an option to enable the tinymce editor within the post/page excerpt box. Now, you can create your custom excerpts using the power of Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Added an option to show the post/page ID in the admin menu for posts and pages. This is extremely helpful if you are using plugins which require you to enter the post or page ID. A HUGE timesaver.
* Added a few more "Save your Selection" buttons, so it's not just one button at the bottom of the page.  It doesn't matter which button your use, they all function the same.  It's more for convenience.
* Be sure to visit my support forum to see usage examples of Ultimate TinyMCE.  It's the best way to follow along with updates, video and image turorials, and knowledgeable community members. http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1
* The direct URL for the new features included in this update is here:  http://www.forum.joshlobe.com/showthread.php?tid=19
* As always, please go back and click "Works" again to help spread this plugin.

= 1.6.2 =
* Added support for div, iframe, object, param, embed, and pre tags.  You can now safely use these tags (and any attributes) while switching between Visual and HTML mode.  Also, they will not be stripped away when you publish a page.
* Incorporated some of the functionality from "TinyMCE Clear".  This allows you to use "clear div" tags and elements.  This option will have to be selected in the admin panel "Ultimate TinyMCE" settings page.  It will also add three new buttons to row 1 of the editor in Visual mode.
* You can now retain P and BR tags, if you use a style.  Please see my <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">SUPPORT FORUM</a> for more information about how to use this feature.
* Be sure to check the <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">FORUM</a> anyway.  I have also added some news about newfound Keyboard Shortcuts.
* If you're happy and you know it... please go back and click "works" again for the new version.


= 1.6.1 =
* Added a new options box on the settings page for enabling/disabling two of the advanced features; Advanced Link and Custom Styles.
* These two features will be disabled by default when activating the upgrade.  If you use these features, you must "check" them in the admin panel settings page.
* Leaving these boxes "unchecked" will restore the default WordPress functionality of the insert/edit link button and the styles dropdown list respectively.
* My form only allows 100 submissions per month (free service).  So, if my feedback form doesn't show, you know why.
* Additional testing for compatibility with WordPress 3.3.  No known issues at this time.

= 1.6.0 =
* Added a community support forum for more concentrated and expedited help.  The links can be found in the Ultimate TiynMCE settings panel, or on the active plugins page under Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Added a section in the settings page for bloggers.  Read the info, and follow along if you like this plugin.
* Added code templates for my next few planned upgrades.

= 1.5.9 =
* Fixed bug where tinymce was adding crazy white space.  I thought my last release had fixed this issue, but apparently it's not ready.
* I could use some extra testers for new versions.  If interested, please contact me using one of the methods on the plugin main download page.  Thanks.

= 1.5.8 =
* Working on ways to make formatting to not get stripped by tinymce.  Added default ability of transforming use of the enter key into "&nbsp" characters.  This should help with line spacing when switching between Visual and HTML modes.
* Adjusted various default behaviors of the tinymce initialization process.
* Added Dutch and Finnish Translations.

<strong>New Features:</strong>

* Added ability to use PHP code inside text widgets.
* Added a signoff shortcode feature.  If you always "sign" your posts the same way, this option will allow you to insert it into your editor via a simple shortcode.
* Both of these can be enabled/disabled in the settings menu.

= 1.5.7 =
* Received a few messages regarding the buttons disappearing when activating the plugin.  This was caused by the __construct() function conflicting with other plugins using the same function.  I rewrote the code so the construct function is no longer needed.  This has helped speed up tinymce loading time significantly.
* Added Japanese to the language translations.

= 1.5.6 =

* Changed all text strings to support language localization.  Please contact me if you would like to help with a translation.
* Fixed image paths to support wordpress installations in subdirectories.  Thanks to Redcocker - http://www.near-mint.com/blog/

= 1.5.5 =

* Added functionality to create shortcodes for use within the editor. (Please see the Microsoft Word documentation on the plugin settings page in the admin panel for complete usage instructions).
* Updated the Microsoft Word documentation to include support for iframe's.

= 1.5.4 =

* Added a couple of screencasts and a word document to help with how to use the TinyMCE.  These can be found in the admin panel settings page, under "Additional Resources".
* Added a few advanced featuers to the HR button.  This button will again be un-selected by default.  You will need to re-enable the button in the admin panel.
* Cleaned up some code, and reduced some of the functions into arrays.  This will have a pretty unnoticeable, yet still effective, decrease in tinymce loading time.

= 1.5.3 =

* Added a button for working with embedding audio, video, and flash files.
* Added a custom styles drop-down list... with plans on adding more.  Please let me know what you would like included here.
* Added a form to the admin settings page; please use this form to pass along your ideas to me.

= 1.5.2 =

* I've been working on this one for a while... You're going to love it!!  ULTIMATE MOODS.
* Ultimate Moods will add a new button in your visual editor window.  You will have over fifty, nifty, thrifty little animated smilies to choose from and insert them directly into your posts/pages.
* This little upgrade is sure to bring a new "look and feel" to your blogpages.  It's both FUN and FRESH!!
* Remember you will need to enable the button in the admin panel settings page.
* I'm thinking about working on a paid version which will include hundreds of new animated moods.  Please give me some feedback and let me know what you think.
* Don't forget to <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=A9E5VNRBMVBCS">donate</a> if you can spare a dollar or two ;)  This upgrade took some time, and I'm sure many of you will enjoy.
* Fixed bug where having to save each row individually.  Now, you can make your changes to both rows, and save once.


= 1.5.1 =

* Made some minor adjustments to code.  Renamed my functions to be more unique.
* Noted the "save" buttons to make aware you must click the save button for each row accordingly.
* Added "settings" link to the plugin page where plugins are listed.
* Included a new set of BIG smilies.  These will surely draw some attention on your pages.
* Added link to please vote for this plugin.

= 1.5 =

* Fixed bug where Row 3 buttons were not saving.

= 1.4 =

* Beautified the admin panel for button selection.
* Renamed my functions so they will be unique.
* Added resources tab in admin panel linking to help sections.

= 1.3 =

* Replaced "Example Text" with small icons of each button.  Now you can visually see which button you are enabling or disabling.
* Added a stylesheet for future upgrades.  This fixed a small bug where it was throwing an error.  I apologize if anyone was caught by this "speedbump".

= 1.2 =

* Added an admin control where you can choose which buttons you would like to display in the editor.
* Adds an option menu in the admin panel under Settings -> Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Simply select which buttons you would like to add to your editor.
* Note: All buttons are NOT selected by default on first install.

= 1.1 =

* This plugin is exactly like my Ultimate Visual Editor Upgrade plugin; except this plugin does NOT include the 291 Google Webfonts.  I realized the increased load the fonts puts on the server because each font calls a separate HTML request.  So, I created this plugin to use in the mean time until I can figure out a better solution.
* Plugin was created.
